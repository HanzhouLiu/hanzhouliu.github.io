<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Howdy! I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University, where I focus on algorithm design for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to tackle real-world challenges in low-level computer vision.

My research emphasizes on restoring high-quality images from degraded or blurred inputs. I leverage state-of-the-art techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and State Space Models (SSMs), to push the boundaries of image restoration.

In addition to 2D vision, I have hands-on experience with 3D scene segmentation using large-scale multi-modal datasets. My work involves training and deploying deep models on GPU clusters, with a strong focus on scalability and efficiency.

Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and sequence modeling, aiming to develop more holistic and interpretable solutions for both image and video understanding.

<!--My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
